I aim to develop a codebase adhering to accessibility standards to ensure the website is inclusive and user-friendly. By doing so, I optimize the site for search engines, enhancing its visibility and reach to a broader audience

## What problem does it solve ?
Accessibility: By adhering to accessibility standards, the codebase ensures that the website is designed and developed in a way that accommodates users with various abilities and disabilities. This inclusivity allows a broader audience, including individuals with visual or motor impairments, to access and interact with the website seamlessly.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO): The Search engines value accessible and well-structured content, making it easier to crawl and index the site. This, in turn, enhances the site's visibility in search engine results, driving more organic traffic,also positively impacts the website's search engine ranking.
